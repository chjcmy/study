# MySQL 고급 문법 가이드

## 9. WITH 절 (Common Table Expression, CTE)

### 기본 WITH 구문
```sql
WITH cte_name AS (
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```
예시:
```sql
WITH high_performers AS (
    SELECT name, grade
    FROM students
    WHERE grade > 4.0
)
SELECT * FROM high_performers
WHERE name LIKE '김%';
```

### 재귀 CTE
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte_name AS (
    -- 초기 쿼리 (non-recursive term)
    SELECT initial_columns
    FROM initial_table
    WHERE initial_condition
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- 재귀 쿼리 (recursive term)
    SELECT recursive_columns
    FROM cte_name
    JOIN some_table ON join_condition
    WHERE recursive_condition
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name;
```
예시 (조직도 계층 구조):
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
    -- 최상위 매니저 찾기
    SELECT id, name, manager_id, 1 as level
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- 하위 직원 찾기
    SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id, eh.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    INNER JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.id
)
SELECT * FROM employee_hierarchy;
```

## 10. 윈도우 함수 (Window Functions)

### ROW_NUMBER()
```sql
SELECT 
    name,
    grade,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY grade DESC) as rank
FROM students;
```

### RANK()와 DENSE_RANK()
```sql
SELECT 
    name,
    grade,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY grade DESC) as rank,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY grade DESC) as dense_rank
FROM students;
```

### PARTITION BY를 사용한 윈도우 함수
```sql
SELECT 
    department,
    name,
    salary,
    AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) as dept_avg,
    MAX(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) as dept_max
FROM employees;
```

### LAG와 LEAD 함수
```sql
SELECT 
    date,
    value,
    LAG(value) OVER (ORDER BY date) as previous_value,
    LEAD(value) OVER (ORDER BY date) as next_value
FROM time_series;
```

## 11. 고급 조인 테크닉

### FULL OUTER JOIN (MySQL에서 구현)
```sql
SELECT * FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id
UNION
SELECT * FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id
WHERE table1.id IS NULL;
```

### CROSS JOIN (카테시안 곱)
```sql
SELECT * FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

### SELF JOIN
```sql
SELECT 
    e1.name as employee,
    e2.name as manager
FROM employees e1
LEFT JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.id;
```

## 12. 고급 서브쿼리 테크닉

### 상관 서브쿼리 (Correlated Subquery)
```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees e1
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM employees e2
    WHERE e1.department = e2.department
);
```

### EXISTS와 NOT EXISTS
```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM orders o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.id
    AND o.amount > 1000
);
```

### 다중 열 서브쿼리
```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE (customer_id, amount) IN (
    SELECT customer_id, MAX(amount)
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
);
```

## 13. 고급 그룹화 테크닉

### ROLLUP
```sql
SELECT 
    department,
    job_title,
    SUM(salary) as total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department, job_title WITH ROLLUP;
```

### GROUPING SETS
```sql
SELECT 
    COALESCE(department, 'All Departments') as department,
    COALESCE(job_title, 'All Jobs') as job_title,
    SUM(salary) as total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY 
    GROUPING SETS (
        (department, job_title),
        (department),
        (job_title),
        ()
    );
```

## 14. JSON 관련 기능

### JSON 컬럼 생성
```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    data JSON
);
```

### JSON 데이터 삽입
```sql
INSERT INTO events VALUES (1, '{"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "Seoul"}');
```

### JSON 데이터 조회
```sql
SELECT 
    JSON_EXTRACT(data, '$.name') as name,
    JSON_EXTRACT(data, '$.age') as age
FROM events;

-- 또는 -> 연산자 사용
SELECT 
    data->'$.name' as name,
    data->'$.age' as age
FROM events;
```

## 15. 성능 최적화 기법

### 인덱스 생성
```sql
-- 단일 컬럼 인덱스
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON table_name (column_name);

-- 복합 인덱스
CREATE INDEX idx_name_age ON table_name (name, age);

-- 유니크 인덱스
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_email ON users (email);
```

### 실행 계획 확인
```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

### 힌트 사용
```sql
-- 인덱스 힌트
SELECT /*+ INDEX(table_name idx_name) */ *
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

-- 조인 순서 힌트
SELECT /*+ JOIN_ORDER(t1, t2, t3) */ *
FROM table1 t1
JOIN table2 t2
JOIN table3 t3;
```

## 16. 트랜잭션 제어

### 트랜잭션 시작과 종료
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
    -- SQL 문장들
COMMIT;
-- 또는
ROLLBACK;
```

### 세이브포인트 사용
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
    INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (1, 'a');
    SAVEPOINT sp1;
    INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (2, 'b');
    ROLLBACK TO sp1;
COMMIT;
```

### 트랜잭션 격리 수준 설정
```sql
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
```
