Create and populate the sub-topic files (`01_함수의_극한과_연속.md`, `02_미분.md`, `03_적분.md`, `04_다변수_미적분.md`) with content from the original file. 4. Create the `목차.md` file with links to the new sub-topics. 5. Delete the original `/Users/choeseonghyeon/Documents/study/ai/기초 수학 학습/01_미적분학.md` file. 6. After the refactoring is complete, begin the iterative content generation phase for the calculus sub-topics, starting with `01_함수의_극한과_연속.md`. This involves reading the file, expanding it with detailed explanations and practice problems, writing the new content back, and asking the user for confirmation before moving to the next file.",
